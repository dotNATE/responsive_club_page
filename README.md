# Responsive Club Page - Practice Project

## Intro

This is a responsive web page project aimed at building on my CSS experience, particularly in responsive web design. It is part of the Full Stack Engineer Path from Code Academy. (https://www.codecademy.com/).

Most of the images that I am intending to use are screenshots from Minecraft. I've made this decision as it's easy to generate content with a consistent format and theme, and as few are likely to view this project.

The brief outlines loose requirements to build a responsive web page for a local, or fictional, 'club'.

## Goals

1. I'm intending to make use of em's and rem's, in particular, as previous pages that I've built have relied on percentages or fixed font sizes.
2. My page should be responsive, changing the way some elements are displayed based on the size of the device being used. I'm not 100% confident with @media rules; this is something I'm hoping I can change with this project.

## Technologies

HTML5, CSS3
